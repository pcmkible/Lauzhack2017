Idea number 1:

Calculate number of incoming transactions. In case there is a spike, regard these transactions as illegal.

Status: to be implemented in C++ code, python results look very good.


Idea number 2:

Calculate number of outgoing transactions. In case there is a spike, there might be a money laundering scheme.

Status: not done.



Idea number 3:

At every time calculate the amount of money certain person has. In case he has a lot of money(or lost a lot), it is a sign
of money laundering or extortion.

Status: done in python, to be done in C++.

Idea number 4:

Investigate the topology of the graph. Find circles which indicate money laundering. Done in C++, results probably good.


Idea number 5:

Visualize every single thing we do. Excell! 

Status: To be done in last hour probably.


Idea number 6:

Investigate atm machines. There is for sure something here, I did not look into this.
