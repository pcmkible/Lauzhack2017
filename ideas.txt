Status: Implemented in C++ code.

Assigned to: Aleksa


Idea number 2:

Calculate number of outgoing transactions. In case there is a spike, there might be a money laundering scheme.

Idea number 3:

At every time calculate the amount of money certain person has. In case he has a lot of money(or lost a lot), it is a sign
of money laundering or extortion.

Status: done in python, to be done in C++.

Assigned to Aleksa.
